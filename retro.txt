# What did we not like?
x Code with me bugs (ja)
X feels way too 'enterprisey' (bn) (+1 ag)
X intellij codewithme (bn) (+100 ag)
X felt like we talked over each other and didn't honour the mobbing roles at times (ag) (+2)
X too data class oriented? (ag)

# What do you think of the rules of object calisthenics
X i like but we shouldn't be fundamentalist about OO where it makes sense  (ja)
X very good practice avoiding getters and setters  (ja)
X some make sense but some are just way too obnoxious (e.g. no getters) (bn)
X object calisthenics feels like an interesting exercise but (ironically) led to bloated code (ag)
